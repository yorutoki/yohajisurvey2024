                WHAT IF Seimei and Haruaki are the same person?
                <br><br>
                Now, I know what you’re thinking “Anon, what the hell? They’re literally the same soul, aka
                reincarnation.” BUT WAIT—what if Seimei isn’t Haruaki’s past life, but actually his future self?
                <br><br>
                “Anon, what the fu-”
                <br><br>
                LET ME FINISH. Okay, maybe I’ve consumed too much Pixiv and AO3 fanfiction lately, but hear me out.
                Remember when Ranmaru found Seimei sleeping with that cat youkai? What if that moment triggered
                something in Seimei, a memory of Tamao (Tamao is in his top 10 most precious people, trust me guys). And
                what if Seimei’s connection to Haruaki isn’t just about reincarnation, but about some future
                catastrophe?
                <br><br>
                Imagine this, Haruaki somehow messes up big-time or gets caught up in some divine chaos and ends up
                stranded in the Heian era ALONE. He’s forced to survive and adapt to this ancient world, completely
                isolated. Then, one day, he meets a young Ashiya, and the first thing he does is cry because the weight
                of everything he’s lost (and everything he’s yet to gain) hits him all at once.
                <br><br>
                And THEN BOOM parallels! Just like when Ashiya met Haruaki for the first time and cried, the same thing
                happens when Seimei meets young Ashiya. It’s a full circle moment of heartbreak and connection.
                <br><br>
                …Okay, so maybe I’m not just cooking this theory, I’ve burned the whole kitchen down. Im glad im anon,
                nobody will call me stupid and judge me or anything heh 😼
            </div>
            <div class="textbox">This one's from the longest answer I got for the "Gush about your faves" question, at
                848 words!
                <br><br>
                And this is an idea that's super intriguing to me too! (I love any idea where Seimei is like a
                fourth-wall-breaking cryptid lmao)
                <br><br>
                And also the sentence "Seimei is a future Haruaki who went back to the past" is really funny to say and
                think about
                <br><br>
                --- HYPOTHETICAL ZONE ---
                <br><br>
                ...which would also be a kinda fucked up situation to put Haruaki in: If Seimei is a future Haruaki,
                what happens after he goes back in time to become Seimei? Is there a Haruaki that exists beyond that
                point? Isn't he stable time loop doomed? Stuck living this span of time forever?
                <br><br>
                --- END OF HYPOTHETICAL ZONE ---
                <br><br>
                Anyway it's a fun idea haha!! lol!!
