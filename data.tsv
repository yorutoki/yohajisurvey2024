I love how Akisame feel like just another funny student that keep failing at first but becoming studious and admire Haruaki which inspire him to be a teacher. He also have consistently shown to really care for him and I found it so cute and touching.

Of course, the principal and Ranmaru are right up there and I mean it both in the 'thats a great ship' and on the 'this realtionship doesn't even need to be a ship for it to intrigue me' kind of way, amazing characters. I also adore Haruaki, Izuna and Miki friendship, teachers friendship my beloved, the chapter where Haruaki sees a world where he is a student and, therefore, not their friend was absolutely amazing (and also hit very differently after Meiji Romance)	Principal my beloved, his smile when he told Haruaki he just wanted to show Seimei all he acomplished after a thousand years quickly became one of my favorite manga scenes ever. 	Actually, it didn't change much, I guess Izuna is the only that moved up quite a bit along the way, at first, I would have put Mame above him, but since the bar scene where he talked abou already being friends with Haruaki, he's been one of my favorites (I do enjoy mysterious masked characters so... the principal was a point of interest since day one)	No	Thank you very much for all the translations and all the hard work, also, sorry if there's anything kinda weird on my responses, english isn't my first language!

12/26/2024 14:18:57	Tumblr	Manga reader	2023	I think I liked how refreshing it was since most of the time protagonists like Haru are put down for being weak or pathetic but as you read through the manga, he‚Äôs actually one of the most moral and strong people with their own willpower and strength (excluding his powers) despite being surrounded by others who would typically squash him like a job.  It‚Äôs also nice to find another supernatural manga that explores Japanese folklore and the different yokai, plus even the supporting characters feel so fun and not just 1 dimensional. In short, I like how at the end, everything feels a fun layered cake that you peel away to get to the diamond. (Sort of like gintama or enstarsüòÖ)	Haru!!	Takahashi, Ame (I kind of want him to appear more in the manga so he can just watch him mix with the freakiness of the class and the yokai world), the principal	The potential ships (Miki/Haru, Fuji/Ogoso, Seimei/douman), the bond between Haru and the class, our idiot trio, family and basically everybodyüòÖ	Haru is one of the cutest babies ever! (Why do I feel like Ame or Mama/Papa-Aki just said this )	Miki, hatanaka and our shitty/money loving troupe captain üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ	No	I kind of want to see what happens if Haru ends up in a horror movie set up like Annabelle or Ju-on, will he just become anti-ghost/demon repellent and exorcise the curse/evil on sight? <br>Though it would be probably more hilarious if the evil is trying to get to him but Haru being Haru just evades everything in a comedy montage.

12/26/2024 14:20:26	Twitter	Read the manga after seeing the anime	Post anime announcement (Dec 2023 - Oct 2024)	At first, I see the anime trailer on July 2024 on Insta. At that time I got intrested to Yohaji 'cause it seem to be a comedy anime. So on November I decided to watch it and of course it was a good anime. Then I found a post on insta that showing Yohaji manga(chapter 48 the Shutendouji arc) then I'm a little curious and read the manga online. To be honest, I'm not a manga reader and I had no read any manga, but I don't know why this anime makes me interest to read the manga. Above my expectations, Yohaji is not only a comedy manga, it has heartwarming scene and serious scene. From that, I really like Yohaji especially I really love Haruaki ><. Sorry I text to much 'cause I really love Yohaji ‚ô°‚ô°	Abe Haruaki	Abe no Seimei, Principal(Ashiya Douman), and Marshmallow	Haruaki and Sano, Haruaki and Seimei, Ebisu and Ame, Principal and Ranmaru, Ame and Hatanaka, Miki and Marshmallow, etc	Haruaki makes people happy and comfortable with him. I loves his "peacefully" motto. I can't explain, but I really like his personality and his character development. 	The same as my current faves, Haruaki-kun as always ^^	No	I'm very grateful 'cause there is many people that likes Yohaji. I hope oneday I could meet someone who has a big interest in Yohaji, so I could always talks about Yohaji. Thanks for you who translate Mai Tanaka twitter so I can know the meaning ^^. Your post translate of Mai Tanaka twitter is one of the factor that made me want to know Yohaji more. Thanks for your all hardwork!

12/26/2024 14:37:10	Tumblr	Manga reader	2023	Haruaki, the plot twists, the unhinged yet wonderful humour in it and the magnificent storyline. I like how the author gives us an indepth intel on every character whether minor or not. I'm really excited for wtv the author is planning for the Ebisu and Kurahashi arc. 	HARUAKI OBVIOUSLY!!!	Miki, Akira and Sano	Haruaki x Miki  Fuji √ó Ogoso Momoyama x Yanagida  I liked Kurahashi x Toubyou too but seeing the current flow of the story I don't think that'll be possible.	I feel like Momoyma x Yanagida is really underrated for some reason T.T . They're quite canon for me. Takahashi and Yamazaki reminds of Buddy Daddies with Utagawa as Miri.	Fuji, Tamao and Mame (and everyone else)	No	Thank you so much for your translations, I'm really grateful to you for them and I was overjoyed and happy finding your page on Tumblr, I make sure to check every week to see new updates.

12/26/2024 15:43:30	Tumblr	Manga reader	2019	I think I was just going through random mangas and was probably gonna drop until I read the Tokyo rescue arc. Like the whole Ebisu introduction and me being surprised there was going to be plot. Then I got more hooked when Nyuudou hinted at his family issues during the summer chapters, bc i wasn‚Äôt expecting for the  students to have backstories aside from Sano.  	HARUAKI ABE	Toubyou, Satsuki, Kashima	Sano+Haruaki Haruaki+Miki+hatankana Beniko+Hijita+mame+sano	Initially I liked Toubyou bc his design reminded of Lemon from Tbhk, i just found him to be fun character. But now he has so much potential with his relationship with kurahashi. <br><br>Speaking of potential, Tanamai needs to implement some of Satsuki irl lore into the story. It fits so well with the setting of Yohaji, since she was human sorcerer during the heian period who was against how Kyoto ruled.  She is such a silly character and im glad the anime is gifting us with more Satsuki appearances.<br><br> Kashima has my heart despite his limited appearances, I need him to appear more. Like he has a tsukkomi personality, is weak even though he‚Äôs a oni and is as smart as Fuji. He also very fun to doodle with shocked and uncomfortable expressions. I am so happy with his recent appearances, I really wasn‚Äôt expecting him to be on the volume cover.

Also each character has an important role to each other with the timeline that also connected is the BEST!!!	The principal Acchan!	Haruaki, Suzaku, and Takahashi-Sensei	Relationship between Acchan and Suzaku The trios Abe Haruaki, Miki Rintarou, and Izuna Hatanaka Also the friendship between Takahashi-Sensei and Doppel 	At first I found it difficult to decide my favorite, they are all good! But after I reread the manga several times, I realized that Acchan is quite interesting character! Like... At first he's kinda bit tsundere, but in the main timeline he is more polite and gentle?! Also the backstory!! His determination really moved my heart. Like he really built the yokai civilization from scratch. And when he said he wanted to show Seimei the results of his hardwork to Haru I really cried. But sometimes he still has some bad habits left over and I find that quite cute.<br><br>Honestly, I like all the characters. I can blabbering too long if I mentioned them all üò≠<br>	Sano Mikoto	No	Sorry if my English is messy. But, I want to thank you for your contribution!

12/26/2024 21:22:27	Twitter	Manga reader	2023	The art style. Also, when I first found out about this manga, I was really into anime with a y≈çkai theme, so I was immediately interested in reading it, lol. What made me even more certain to read Yohaji was probably the scene where Haruaki hides under the teacher's desk, and Sano tries to help him out	Sanoo üôå	Haruaki ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è	Haruaki-Sano (yeah, I ship them). The Hatanaka-Mame-Tama trio and the friendship between Renren-Tama-Afro‚ÄîI mean, Mujina	Hmm, does this mean favorite character or favorite character dynamic? I‚Äôll just write about both if you don‚Äôt mind, hehe.<br><br>About my favorite character, which is Sano‚Äîlike I mentioned earlier, when I first saw him, I immediately thought of Shizuo and Abeno from FnM. I became even more certain he was my favorite character when I found out he‚Äôs a tsundere, hahaha! Plus, it‚Äôs nice to add him to my collection of favorite blonde characters, hihi.<br><br>As for Haruaki, when I found out his birth month is February, I immediately thought, ‚ÄòHa! My feelings weren‚Äôt wrong for liking you!‚Äô I have this habit of getting overly excited whenever I find out a character I like shares the same birth month as me‚Äî üò≠ hahaha.<br><br>Honestly, when it comes to favorite characters, it doesn‚Äôt stray far from Sano and Haruaki. The rest are just characters I like or find interesting. Speaking of other characters besides those two, for some reason, I‚Äôm drawn to Maeda, haha! I rarely like female characters, but Utagawa, Momo, and Mami (Mame‚Äôs cousin) managed to catch my attention.<br><br>I quite like Utagawa‚Äôs backstory, her responsible attitude as the vice class president (especially when paired with Nyuudo), and the fact that she looks so cute in the anime, haha‚Äîsame with Momo. I didn‚Äôt expect Momo to be shown as close to Yanagida, hhhh. As for Mami, I love her character design. Her moments with Mame are also some of my favorite scenes!<br><br>As for other characters, I‚Äôm interested in Hijita, Mujina, and Ame‚Äîah, speaking of Ame, I‚Äôm drawn to him because of his Kansai dialect in the anime üò≠. I rarely hear anime characters speak in Kansai dialect (except for Hattori from DC, but I still feel a bit unsure about adapting to that dialect), and when I heard Ame speak, wow... Ame became the trigger for me to search for other anime characters with Kansai dialects, lol.<br><br>Back to the topic, another character might be Takahashi. When I first read the manga, I thought Takahashi was just a simple school doctor. I didn‚Äôt expect him to play a role in Yohaji‚Äôs lore, haha. The most surprising thing about him was finding out that the person who told him to become a doctor was Haruaki himself, hhhh. Before, I thought it was his father üò≠.<br><br>TanaMai-sensei is amazing at creating plot twists and foreshadowing (‚Å†‚Å†¬¥‚Å†œâ‚Å†ÔΩÄ‚Å†‚Å†).<br><br>For character dynamics... Honestly, forgive me, but Haruaki and Sano really grab my attention and have completely stolen my heart üò≠. Their ship dynamic is exactly the kind I love, haha. It‚Äôs a huge plus and something that excites me whenever there‚Äôs anything related to the two of them.<br><br>Although, the challenge is their relationship as a teacher and a student üòî. To be honest, I‚Äôm not someone who usually likes teacher-student ships, but somehow, they‚Äôre an exception for me, hhhh. Umm... I don‚Äôt want this to get too long, and honestly, I‚Äôm also not sure what else to talk about, so for now, this is all I want to share about the things I like. Thank you!	I forgot, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the first character I liked was Haruaki. However, for some reason, my memory tells me it was Sano, because the first time I saw Sano, I immediately thought of Shizuo from Durarara, who is also one of my favorite characters, haha! But I‚Äôm quite sure the first character I really liked was Haruaki(‚Å†*‚Å†¬¥‚Å†œâ‚Å†ÔΩÄ‚Å†*‚Å†)	No	I want to thank you so much for translating the Yohaji manga and for continuously providing information about it.

12/27/2024 0:00:09	Discord	Manga reader	2024, irrelevant to anime announcement	I first found out about Yohaji by reading random mangas for fun and I came across Yohaji. I kept praying the whole time because it was very cute and wholesome but I was afraid it would turn out to be a harem manga again, where all the girls would fall in love with the teacher or something (I am not really fond of this genre). And Im glad it did not turn out that way.   At that time the unofficial translation of the manga in my country stopped at like chapter 7. I was so hooked that I found the english translation to read IMMEDIATELY. I read the things twice, like back to back and then get hyperfixation on it.	Akisame Tamao	Abe Haruaki, Nyuudou Rensuke, Hatanaka Izuna	I randomly ship EbiAme (Ebisu x Ame) for shits and giggles because they are both brocons, and the fact that they barely even interact in the manga, I shipped them way before the chapter where they meet too. Then suddenly I cant stop thinking about them lol  I love the relationship between Haru and his class too! They build up their bonds day by day, super cute and wholesome! I feel like noone is left behind!  And the friendship between Tama and Renren is justttt something else! I love them!!	I LOVE ALL YOHAJI CHARACTERS AND DETAILS SO ITS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO CHOOSE ONE/SOME OF THE CHARACTERS TO BE MY FAVE ON THIS SURVEY <br><br>BUT! Tama! First, I really just like him normally like other characters but he slowly grows on me. His character development is really simple but its so relatable and so cute.<br><br>From a lazy cat who cant even get his name right to the cat that tries to study, thinking that if he studies hard enough, his teacher will wake up from the dream. From a cat who wants to be a pet cat of his best friend in the future to the cat that dreams of being a teacher like Seimei. These bring tears to my eyes. Especially, we can see his score get better and better in every chapter, that little detail makes my day brighter and motivates me too! I want to try hard and work hard like Tama too! <br><br>And I know for sure that Tama will beat Renren at Japanese before graduation!

12/27/2024 0:44:12	Twitter	Manga reader	Post anime release (Oct 2024 - now)	At first, I watched the first episode on my iPad at school, but it was honestly so embarrassing. I didn‚Äôt have my earphones, so everyone could hear it, and a group of boys gathered behind my seat, clearly watching my screen and judging me. I felt so awkward because some parts of the anime felt super cringe in a public setting. But despite that, my curiosity got the better of me.  Afterward, I checked the comment section, and a lot of people were recommending the manga instead, saying it was much better. I decided to give it a shot because I needed a break from all the isekai anime I‚Äôd been watching. The supernatural, traditional youkai themes felt fresh and unique, something I hadn‚Äôt come across recently. Plus, the chapters were really long, which made me happy since it felt like I was getting a lot more content.   I got hooked during the arc where Haruaki becomes a student, and the Kyoto trip arc completely sealed the deal for me  it was so‚Ä¶ interesting‚Ä¶ I also loved the little translation notes at the end of the chapters, made me want to learn more about youkai!	My goat Abe no Seimei	Haruaki and Ashiya douman	Ranmaru+seimei+ashiya (they have so much plot holes together‚Ä¶) , animal trio  (i love when they sunbathe together and gossip time) , teachers trio+principal (for giggle n shit+i need ashiya to socialize+has more screentime+i just love ashiya douman). 	Well im not going to talk about the beauty of Seimei or Haruaki but im going to yap about them and make theories about them! <br><br>Okay, hear me out on this theory I cooked up during a latenight spiral: what if Seimei is actually the editor of Yohaji? Or what if he‚Äôs Yohaji‚Äôs assistant? Or maybe Tanamai‚Äôs coworker? Just kidding, now serious‚Ä¶<br><br>WHAT IF Seimei and Haruaki are the same person?<br><br>Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúAnon, what the hell? They‚Äôre literally the same soul, aka reincarnation.‚Äù BUT WAIT‚Äîwhat if Seimei isn‚Äôt Haruaki‚Äôs past life, but actually his future self?<br><br>‚ÄúAnon, what the fu-‚Äù<br><br>LET ME FINISH. Okay, maybe I‚Äôve consumed too much Pixiv and AO3 fanfiction lately, but hear me out. Remember when Ranmaru found Seimei sleeping with that cat youkai? What if that moment triggered something in Seimei, a memory of Tamao (Tamao is in his top 10 most precious people, trust me guys). And what if Seimei‚Äôs connection to Haruaki isn‚Äôt just about reincarnation, but about some future catastrophe?<br><br>Imagine this, Haruaki somehow messes up big-time or gets caught up in some divine chaos and ends up stranded in the Heian era ALONE. He‚Äôs forced to survive and adapt to this ancient world, completely isolated. Then, one day, he meets a young Ashiya, and the first thing he does is cry because the weight of everything he‚Äôs lost (and everything he‚Äôs yet to gain) hits him all at once.<br><br>And THEN BOOM parallels! Just like when Ashiya met Haruaki for the first time and cried, the same thing happens when Seimei meets young Ashiya. It‚Äôs a full circle moment of heartbreak and connection.<br><br>‚Ä¶Okay, so maybe I‚Äôm not just cooking this theory, I‚Äôve burned the whole kitchen down. Im glad im anon, nobody will call me stupid and judge me or anything heh üòº <br><br>Anyway Seimei with Clairvoyance theory actually makes more sense than whatever am i cooking here‚Ä¶ <br><br>Okay, hear me out again, WHAT IF Seimei and Haruaki‚Äôs moms are kitsune? I mean, in real life, Abe no Seimei supposedly had a kitsune mom, so it wouldn‚Äôt be that far-fetched. We don‚Äôt know much about Yohaji‚Äôs version of Abe no Seimei, but Haruaki‚Äôs mom? She‚Äôs kinda suspicious imo. <br><br>At first, I thought, ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs just an old lady with gray hair, it‚Äôs normal aging stuff.‚Äù But then I noticed that in the anime, she already had white hair when Haruaki and Amaaki were kids. So I thought, ‚ÄúHmm, maybe she‚Äôs albino?‚Äù But then I saw your theory about Haruaki‚Äôs mom on Tumblr, and now everything‚Äôs clicking!<br><br>Okok so this is a supernatural manga, yet there‚Äôs no kitsune anywhere. That‚Äôs kinda weird, right? In other media with youkai, in my experience, there‚Äôs always at least one kitsune character like, it‚Äôs a staple of the genre. But in Yohaji? Nothing about fox things. And then you look at Tanamai‚Äôs design for Haruaki‚Äôs mom, she‚Äôs had white hair since the very start. It‚Äôs definitely raising some eyebrows.<br><br>What if they‚Äôre saving the kitsune reveal for Haruaki‚Äôs mom? Maybe she‚Äôs even the trigger for the reincarnation of Abe no Seimei! Her kitsune blood can influenced Haruaki‚Äôs power and reincarnation. <br><br>Honestly, the more I think about it, the more it kinda makes sense.<br><br>Alright, so here‚Äôs another wild theory (and I swear this is the last one‚Ä¶ for now) What if Seimei put his curse on Douman not out of malice, but so Douman would remember his death and carry on Seimei‚Äôs dream of youkai and humans living together? And so douman could never stop thinking about him and cant forget no matter how much he tries  (Yes, I‚Äôm sneaking in some Douman x Seimei here, don‚Äôt judge me).<br><br>Now, onto my actual last theory (seriously this time). What if Ranmaru, instead of fully hating Seimei, actually cares deeply for him? Like, you know that trope the more you hate someone, the more you actually love them?<br><br>Hear me out, there‚Äôs this fanfic I read where Ranmaru hated Seimei because of his self-destructive tendencies, and honestly, that stuck with me. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs just fanfiction, anon-‚Äù Yeah, sure, but it‚Äôs not impossible! There‚Äôs a chance that Ranmaru‚Äôs ‚Äúhatred‚Äù for Seimei could stem from something deeper, like frustration with Seimei‚Äôs actions or guilt over his sudden death. Maybe Ranmaru hated how Seimei‚Äôs passing left Douman to suffer alone. (This could be ranmaruxdouman or ranmaruxseimei fanfic materials here-) <br><br>Or what if Ranmaru hated Seimei from the start? Maybe Seimei was just too much for him, with his enigmatic nature and unreachable ideals. But even if that‚Äôs the case, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that Ranmaru‚Äôs ‚Äúhatred‚Äù has more layers.<br><br>Anyway, I‚Äôm spiraling again. TANAMAI, PLEASE GIVE US MORE HEIAN ERA CONTENT! I need answers, closure, and maybe a little more emotional destruction.<br><br>What do you think? I honestly need someone to just talk about this lol, i think I'm alone in this country to actively thinking about this‚Ä¶ the only indo fans I encountered are making those pjsk loving cat song jj for the megabillion times‚Ä¶ STOP IT OH MY GOD. 	Akisame tamao (i love catboy), mame (his racoon form is really cute and looks so fluffy cant blame sano for hugging it everytime he transforms üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏èüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏èüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è)	No	Thank you so much for the translation‚Äîyour theories are honestly the fuel that keeps me dreaming about this series! Seriously, they keep my imagination alive.<br><br>Anyway, I‚Äôve got this feeling in my bones that the Gods Arc is coming soon, especially after seeing Kurahashi in the new art Tanamai dropped. It‚Äôs like the pieces are lining up. I think they might kick things off with a basketball tournament, considering Kurahashi‚Äôs on the basketball team. Maybe the gods school challenges Hyakki to a game, and boom we finally dive into Sano‚Äôs backstory before his transfer. Plus, we might get a glimpse into Haruaki‚Äôs previous school that makes him quit after working there for only 30 minutes.<br><br>Oh, and maybe the demon school gets a cameo? Remember when the principal turned down their exchange student offer? I feel like if they send another invitation now, the principal might just toss Haruaki into it because this time, they actually have someone like him to use as a buffer.<br><br>Also, the emergency chapter could be some foreshadowing for future events. Maybe the gods high school will attack, or maybe it‚Äôll be something else entirely. And if there‚Äôs a gods and demons school, could there be an angels school? Or a hero/villain school? Though seriously, how the heck did Medusa end up in Nyuudou‚Äôs army? Not to mention the Takahashi family and their random collection of youkai, it‚Äôs wild.<br><br>And speaking of Nyuudou, in the Haruaki Student Arc, Renren wouldn‚Äôt even exist, right? His dad gets kidnapped (and probably killed) if Haruaki doesn‚Äôt step in during the time travel meiji arc. That would mean Ruri never meets Renren, she stays a normal human, and we‚Äôd never get the Akutagawa we know today. Akira would probably end up as a serial killer in that timeline, too. The possibilities are insane!<br><br>Honestly, the Haruaki Student Arc is one of the most fascinating arcs, but I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll skip it in the anime. It‚Äôs such a shame it‚Äôs what really got me hooked on Yohaji in the first place, even if it left me super confused at times.<br><br>Also, what‚Äôs the deal with the principal and Haruaki in that alternate universe? And did Ranmaru really quit being a teacher? I vaguely remember him joking about it, but I don‚Äôt recall if he actually made the decision. Maybe something else happened in Haruaki‚Äôs teacher timeline that led to him quitting for real.<br><br>Anyway, please keep cooking with your theories, they‚Äôre amazing, and they make diving into this series even more fun. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication! You‚Äôre a legend for keeping the fandom alive.

(especially bc i have a thing for class rep charas) also his arc made me cry a lot and it might be my fav from the entire series.. it makes me so happy that he's loved by the entire class ü•∫<br><br>(i like how most of these are just me talking abt my fav chara type LMFAO I DIDNT MEAN TO RAMBLE THIS LONG I'M SORRY)	I think I used to like renren more???

But when the Youkai Train arc came around, I found myself a little drawn to this one-eyed guy. Not sure why, though. The culture fes made him seem pretty interesting, and when the underground part showed up with his mother, I could feel something was off around him. The Arc Renren part was just peak (I‚Äôm a laid-back guy, I enjoy twists, and his relationship with the pretty girl Kuniko-chan just bored me to sleep that night). I ended up searching for stuff about him on Tanamai's Twitter, and I just knew‚Äîyeah, this is someone I‚Äôd actually want to invest my time in. Then I found out about the manga spin-off with the pet trio. My feelings when I reached chapters 5, 6, 8, and 9? Yeah, that's my guy. It‚Äôs hard to put this feeling into words.

12/28/2024 0:49:02	Tumblr	Read the manga after seeing the anime	Post anime release (Oct 2024 - now)	Hmm maybe the trailer? Because one day, i saw yohaji trailer in instagram and i thought that i'd knew of the voice actors. So i give it a shot. Thank god i didn't drop this anime cuz i dislike yohaji at first because haruaki's fetish on sailor. Like, he's an adult but like sailor, that's kinda made me gross. But i like it now cuz it's like one of his characteristic. What made me continue to read it it's that i love random and comedy manga.	Nyuudou	I love them all equally so i can't choose	1. Nyuudou with tama 2. Akira and yamazaki 3. Gidamomo	I didn't expect that i love nyuudou so much when i'd watched the anime. The first thing i liked about nyuudou is literally his hair, because his hair looks like kenma from haikyuu. But when i read the manga when utagawa saw the boys in bath, i saw it cute when nyuudou blushes later on. And i got addicted to see his blush face (yeah i'm literally the same as haruaki). I like him even more when he's have gentleman personality. And because of that, i like everything about him (and i'm obsessed of him too). What made me shocked is when he said that he once had a crush. I know that he's still a child back then cuz anyone would have a crush. But it made my heart broke when they're promised to get married in the future. When i'd saw that utagawa were ruri, and utagawa and nyuudou will get married too, it make my heart more shattered. I feel so sad whenever i see them in the same panel. Well at least he's happy (i'm not).<br><br>I really like two boys friendship. I don't know how to say it but i just really like nyuudou with akisame so much. And that goes for duo i like in yohaji. For example: douman ranmaru, kurahashi toubyou, akira yamazaki, sano mame, and fujigoso. I'd like hijita nyuudou mujina and tama too. About gidamomo, i like their dynamic (i'm not good at describe things). But what make me more like about gidamomo is almost art about momoyama's birthday, they're always had yanagida. And most of the chapter, they're almost appeared together. I'm sorry momo even though you like sano.		No	I'm still shocked how odawara was in my dream (about a week ago?). In that dream, i was chased by a monster and then odawara appear out of nowhere and help me run away from it. Thank you, odawara. I really appreciate that. As an editor, i want to edit all of my fav, whether it's character, relationship, or scene. But the problem is that i'm too lazy to do all of that. The another reason is i'm having trouble finding audio and transitions too. It's only three but i'm already exhausted. And there's two edit in progress too. Anyway, it's been so long since i liked anime since i'm a picky person and have a weird taste. That's why i feel so empty now cuz i don't know what to read now since i finished reading the manga. Oh and i'm still curious why ranmaru (suzaku) and genbu don't have a good relationship cuz i didn't notice it at all. And it's still get me sad whenever i remembered that panel when kurahashi said that he's not that enjoyed in school cuz i love kurahashi with toubyou so much. Especially when kurahashi foreseen that toubyou will get smacked and kurahashi run into him to protect him. I love about nyuudou handphone wallpaper is akisame in cat form. He's even have akisame cat form plushies. GOSH THERE'S SO MUCH THAT I LIKE IN YOHAJI. I'm still new to yohaji so i'm so sad that it's released every month. Every manga that i read is up every week. But that's okay, at least it's have more pages. Gahh i don't know what to yapping anymore cuz everything in this manga is masterpiece for me. I'm sorry if there's something that's not make sense (i'm not good in english lol). OH AND THANK YOU FOR TRANSLATING YOHAJI AND TANAKA'S ART IN HER TWITTER (or should i say x? i prefer twitter though). I hope you have a better day.

And becoming sOFTER AS A RESULT WHAT IF I THROW UP OH MY GOD. THEY ARE PRECIOUS TO ME. I love how Haruaki makes literally everyone around him soften immediately. His cheer and good vibes are like a virus; he got Sano, he got Miki, and that motherfucker is gonna get Ebisu you wait for it. It's very important to me that Sano learns that being a little freak who screw up all the time like Haruaki isn't bad (wether you're a god, human, or yokai) and he has a whole moment with Ebisu about it??? Like Haruaki reminds Sano of exactly how Ebisu used to be, and Sano telling Ebisu that to his face would be gold, I wanna know how Ebisu would even respond to that.	MikiHaru, Save Me MikiHaru.

Mame is my favorite because he's adorable and friendly and sweet, but then sometimes says the most awful things, and it always makes me bust out laughing. The gap moe is what makes him so cute.

Like‚Äî why do I like them? I‚Äôm gonna do just only two of them so uh hear me out. First is Akira..The character, character concept, his personality, occupation, all of them are just my type I have oc x canon just for him, TBH my opinion is not so appropriate so uh no more details.<br>AND HARUAKI YES YES I would actually put him in the first place if I didn‚Äôt get to read the manga chapter 90+ I think? (BUT HE‚ÄôS STILL NUMBER ONE) Sometimes I called him my child but then again I called him my mom THE cutest person ever his personality his warm heart he‚Äôs the reason that after watching 3 episodes of the show I bought the manga and still ordering them‚Ä¶ aaaaaüò≠üò≠ I wished I were in Japan rn bc I want to eat Christmas-aki cake must be creamy and deliciousüòû<br>AND SPECIAL PLACE can I give a little special appreciation to Mai Tanaka?<br>LIKE The art style..the story üò≠üò≠ Everything is so good the character development and personality the story that was hidden in the story‚Äî But what I like most gotta be character personalities bc I feel‚Ä¶ so real to them?

12/29/2024 2:10:42	Tumblr	Manga reader	2021	I was searching for teacher related manga that weren't sexualised or only focused on highschool girls and making the teachermc look cool. I got interested in yohaji specifically upon seeing how pathetic(positive) the mc is. The first chapter immediately got me hooked. 	Our beloved mc haruaki	Its hard to choose but if i think about who i most like seeing in chapters/ reading about its gotta be seimei, amaaki and the doctor	I love sibling dynamics, I think the "overprotective older brother" trope is fun so haruaki and amaaki aswell as Sano and ebisu.   Ah but also takahashis dynamics with both his brother and adopted daughter kuniko- man I love all of them. All the characters have got such fun dynamics together I can't choose (QvQ)>``	Okay so the reason I love yohaji so much is bc all the characters are literally great and amazing and I love them dearly, there is literally not a single character I hate or don't care about atleast to some agree and I think that's because the author has done such a great job involving all the characters with one another- especially bc at the start haruaki was kind of a loner- seeing him interact with others is so much fun oh haruaki my beloved, also let's talk about character design? Amazing, breathtaking, I wanna eat them. Yohaji is all I ever wanted in a story and has inspired me so much in terms of writing or ocs. Seimei is so mysterious that I'm at the edge of my seat, foaming at the mouth when he finally appears or we get a bit of lore. The way characters that once knew him, now interact with haruaki, having to accept he's not there anymore? I love it. And and there's so many shippable characters too, every character has atleast one person they're close to and I think that really helps in getting us attached to them aswell. I could go on and on about every specific character I love but I fear my hand will explode and I'm low-key procrastinating on my schoolwork and should probably get back to that.

12/29/2024 5:24:00	Twitter	Manga reader	2023	Discovered the series in 2019 because it seemed similar to Fukigen na Mononokean. Wasn't able to find many translated chapters, so I read five chapters then just wrote down the series name and forgot about it. Four years later, I searched up the series on a whim and found much more had been translated, and that's when I got hooked lol. The writing and comedy were just really good.

His spineless personality along with his tendency to be quite the annoying companion made me go absolutely bonkers. However, as I went on, I was met with the insane amount of growth he‚Äôs experienced. Not only that, but I was witness to his good qualities such as his cunning when the situation calls for it, his eagerness to help anyone in need, and most of all- his intelligence that intertwines with kindness; ensuring he‚Äôll probably never stray off the positive path. AND HIS ADORABLE SMILE LIKE AWEE MY BOY!! The way he acts as a beacon of hope in any situation and has proven time and time again to be a great teacher that actually cares about his students has me rushing to read every new chapter that comes out. And A TEACHER HIS STUDENTS DESPERATELY NEED!! His tenaciousness has caused even Tamao to break out of his cycle of bad grades; a yokai is type notorious for their small brain. Like holy cow buddy, how are you so wholesome??? Also, being able to best Ebisu, a god of good luck, at a game is crazy. He‚Äôs just that good.  Overall, Haruaki is an extremely kindhearted man and I love him sm. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

HONESTLY i lowkey didnt like him at the start BUTT HIS ARC LITERALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING... BEST ARC SECOND TO MEIJI ROMANCE HANDS DOWN!!!! it literally shifted the tone of the entire manga ANDD i LOVED seeing how haru and mikis relationship progressed throughout it.... (oh how i love mikiharu) anyways about miki.... I COULD COMPLIMENT EVERYTHING ABT HIS CHARACTER BUT I LOVED HIS PERSONALITY MOST OF ALL!!!!!! WAAGGH I HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR CHARACTERS WHO ARE COLD ON THE INSIDE BUT SWEET ONCE YOU BREAK THROUGH THEIR WALLS üòûüòûüòû THANK YOU HATANAKA FOR BEING HIS ONE AND ONLY FRIEND BEFORE HARUAKI.... IF ONLY HIM AND HARU WERE FRIENDS FROM THE START THEN HIS SEXY MOM WOULDNT HAVE GIVEN HIM ALL THAT TRAUMA WAAAAAAGAGGHHHHH (ok tbh she still wouldve no matter what I HATE MIKIS MOM)<br><br>ok i think thats enough talking about miki for now its time to move onto HATANAKA!!!!!! i lowkey didnt like him at the start either i thought he was just a rando nobody teacher.. BUT DURING THE LATER ARCS AND THE SPIN OFF HE WAS GENUINELY ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS!!!!!! i started kinda liking him in miki arc but it wasn't until the train arc that he really started to become one of my favs.. OHHHH HE WAS SO COOL (and sexy ü§§ü§§ü§§) WHEN HE CAME IN LIKE **BAM** THROUGH THE TRAIN WITH TAKAHASHI!!! AND IN YOSEITO I LOVE THE PART WHERE HE GOES TO SAVE MIKI FROM THE GROUP OF DELINQUENTS IT WAS SO SWEET HOW HE DID ALL THAT FOR HIMMM!!!!! buttt OBVIOUSLY I CANT FORGET MEIJI ROMANCE ARC!!!!!!!! his dedication and love for ibara IS SOOOOOO SWEEEEETTTT THEY'RE MEANT TO BE!! i actually almost KINDA cried at the last part where hatanaka finally reunites with ibara after her waiting for so long HES SUCH A GENTLEMAN... THE WAY HE TREATED KAI THE WHOLE TIME WAS SO AAUGGUUHGH OF HIM TOO he never acted unreasonable towards him just because he was ibaras fianc√© and he rejected him super nicely... I COULD GUSH ABOUT HATANAKA FOREVER LETS MOVE ON TO...<br><br>HARUAKI!! most wholesome character in yohaji 100%. HES SUCH A CUTIE PIE HES SO KIND AND SWEET TO EVERYONE WWAAAAAAAAAAGH WHY WERENT MORE PEOPLE FRIENDS WITH HIM IN THE PAST?????? if he had the power he couldve ended global warming and restored world peace. BUTT im GLAD HES FOUND THE PLACE WHERE HE BELONGS NOW!!!! hes around so many good people that change him for the better.. but he also changes THEM for the better!!!! the way everyones lives basically started revolving around him ever since he joined the school is actually crazy ESPECIALLY SANO'S!! i love his relationship with him so much (NOTTTT IN THAT WAY) it's so funny how obvious his favoritism is towards him.. like how he calls the class "sano-kun and the others" üò≠üò≠ sigh theres so much to say about seimei but ill keep it short<br><br>last but not least.. BENIKO!! unlike the other 3 i liked her immediately from the start. when i first saw her my brain went OH GOOGLY MOOGLY! (NOTTTTTT IN THAT WAY) tbh i don't even know why i like her so much.. i just do ü§î its probably because i barely see any characters like her in animanga. her personality was so refreshing.. we need more characters who are blunt and unapologetic!! her arc was so fun too ANNDD i love her relationship with her dads!! so cute!!! i love her relationship with hijita the most though. i kinda ship them.. i kinda dont... i dunno at this point but all i know is that if they weren't married by 30 they would (platonically) marry eachother. WWAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH i need more opposite gender best friends like them.. seeing them not getting shipped every milisecond IS LIKE DRINKING ICE COLD WATER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHTTT i dont think ive ever seen best friends as casual as them in animanga.<br><br>holy that was a whole lot of yap i promise im not trying to win the longest paragraph thing.. these are my top 3 but my 4th would probably be hijita ü§î i had to give him a shout out cause hes so close to being in the top 3.. hes funny and he basically carried the comedy in the anime.. he was the only guy i found funny in the anime sadly üòûüòû ANYWAYS FOR REAL THIS TIME thats it BYEBYE	Originally it was haru, hijita & beni same as my other faves	No	THANK YOUU for all the work you do for yohaji... you literally carry the entire fandom on your back omg	Rintarou	Haruaki, Hatanaka, Beniko	Rintarou, Hatanaka, Haruaki, Beniko, Hijita	Post anime announcement (Dec 2023 - Oct 2024)	Recommend by friend		Haruaki, Hijita	776	Haruaki & Rintarou, Fuji & Ogoso, Hijita & Beniko

Love how crazy this guy is with his research and the past arc just gives more personality to him and more reason why i love him as a character. The growth he went in that 500 years is *chef's kiss*. He's still batshit crazy but he's doing it for a good reason now. His relationship with yamazaki and utagawa is always nice to read and leaves you feeling fuzzy until he's back to his normal behavior ((ghost train arc beloved)) Feeling a bit sad that season 1 of the anime didnt have much of him but hoping for the best of him on season 2<br><br>Rasetsu climbs to the top of ladder very fast on the fav ranking despite being a newer chara. His character story is really enjoyable and relatable to read. I love this man with all my heart and hoping for the best for him and his current partner. Hoping sensei will show him again in the future arcs<br><br>Rin comes off as a basic character in the early arcs but everything changes after his own character arc. Him pushing away everyone around him because of his mother but despite that haruaki keep trying to befriend him (The way that sensei ties haruaki in rin's past is also very much adorable). And then you got him being beside haruaki lying sleeping in the futon on the dream arc ((he's definitely crying all that time))	Haruaki	No	Thank you for all the TLs on the twt posts and short comics.

Mouse-Sensei has something that I don't know how to describe but it's a pleasure to see him, even when the most "mouse" situation possible is going to happen to him.<br><br>Hatanaka: I could say something similar about Hatanaka, but to be honest, as I read and learned more about him, I became even more fascinated, I really loved this guy. I'm not going to explain much so as not to fall into spoilers or anything, but without a doubt since the Meiji Era Arc, Hatanaka has established himself with many reasons as a good character for me. (Also, characters who wear glasses are a plus for me)<br><br>Sano: Sano is Sano, I leave it there, jk.<br>He is a somewhat curious character for me, in the sense that I probably first saw him as the classic handsome guy who exists alongside the main character, but as the story progresses I can understand him better.<br>The manga actually does a good job of leaving little details about him that it's understandable to want to know more, that, and I really love mysteries.	I don't think I've had any changes in this	No	I never thought I would be so drawn to an anime focused on Yokais, but now I'm grateful that it happened, and it's also very nice to find someone who does translations into English<br>(My first language is Spanish, so finding translations is even harder for mangas that aren't as well-known here, so thanks for the translations)	Oota	Hatanaka, Sano, Mouse-sensei	Oota, Mouse-sensei, Hatanaka, Sano	Post anime release (Oct 2024 - now)	Anime			332	Fuji & Ogoso, Yoseito trio

Ranmaru, Ebisu, and Ogata Kou!!	It's not a ship, but I always like it when Sano take care of our Haruaki. Well, in fact I love it when Haruaki is loved by everyone!

I don't know exactly when or why I like him but before I knew it, I like him. His psychopathic trait is interesting and yeah, sexy. And I love it when his lab coat is sliding down off of his shoulder, like, excuse me? Are you trying to seduce me here, doctor? Goodness, I feel like screaming.	At first I liked Ranmaru the most I think, but Dr. Takahashi's weirdness started to get to me :D	No	Thanks for making this poll, I hope I'm not late to answer this.

1/3/2025 6:03:43	Tumblr	Manga reader	2023	I saw a random picture of Haruaki and thought he was so beautiful I needed to know where he was from immediately (and now I've been obsessed with yohaji for over a year!)	Akisame Tamao	Miki Rintarou	Renren/Tama/Kuniko as a polyship is my ultimate favorite dynamic, and 90% of it is in my head. I have thoughts about them and am insane about those thoughts. Anyone other ship I would list would pale in comparison to how much I love them (Mujina is also a great guy but I romantically ship the three polyamorously and he's not involved with the ship). For friendship either Yoseito trio (Hatanaka, Mame, Tama) or Idiot trio (Hatanaka, Miki, Haruaki). I have Yoseito trio on my smartphone currently, It took me well over a year to change my phone background because of the special meaning that my old one had, but Yoseito trio were that cool to me, but at one time I straight up designed my entire tumblr theme around idiot trio (I walked that back because I don't go on tumblr that much and it was too much effort to code what I envisioned)	Tamaaaaaa Tama Tama Tama I love you Tama I love how cute he is but also how cool he is, and I love his ambitions to be a teacher. I'm behind on the anime so I don't know if they've adapted chapter 10 yet but if they don't I'll cry so hard because chapter 10 (Run, Tamao!!) is one of my favorites of the "slice of life" chapters. I love Renren arc so much, the dynamic between Tama and Renren, and auuuuuuuuuuuuu he's so precious. My blorbo <3 I put him in so many situations (I'm a student and I'm studying languages, when writing practices sentences in other languages I usually have Tama or one of the other yohaji characters as the subject of the sentence <3 It's like he's already teaching someone!) My cutie <3 My catboy <3 I love him <3 My friends who don't know yohaji know him as "[my] catboy" and ask about him sometimes to calm me down when I get upset or something because oh I ramble about how much I love him so much. Tama!! I love him!! He's my avatar picture on Tumblr for a reason <3 I love him so much I want the best for him 1 billion kissies for Tama <3	Miki Rintarou	No	I didn't know about the 2022 poll so I'm glad I got to take part in the 2024 poll (in 2025 XD)	Tamao	Rintarou	Tamao	2023	Characters	Haruaki		212	Nyuudou & Tamao & Kuniko, Yoseito trio			
1/3/2025 7:31:27	Tumblr	Manga reader	2023	saw canada's yohaji summary twitter post and thought yes i do love power of friendship and gay ppl, it looked interesting and would check it out, best decision of my life	Haruaki	Hatanaka, Hijita, Ibara	FujiOgo, dumb idiot teacher trio, Takahashi & Yamazaki	Haruaki - initially I thought it's kind of cliche to pick the protagonist as your #1 fave and I was even kinda surprised to see the 2022 poll results. But then I remembered. That Abe Haruaki has probably the most beautiful character development I've seen in any story. He is a protagonist done so well!! I just reread the manga in 2 days and it made it even more obvious how much Haru has grown from a cowardly, insecure weakling loser to a wholehearted, determined teacher who has gained confidence in himself (his speech at the end of haruaki becomes a student!!) and can empathize with other people precisely because of his cowardly past. And yet the entire time he never loses the vibe that makes him Haruaki. I love cringefail loserboys who have a good heart. He can be silly, he can be stupid, he can be a total scumbag, but he can also be gentle, gets angry for his friends, always sees the best in people, and can be cunning and ingenious when it comes down to it. Love love love seeing the Haruaki army of people (& mandragoras) he's helped who love him and would follow him into anything grow<br><br>Hatanaka - Became one of my faves from the moment he was the first character to give Haruaki a chance. He's just?? Such a sweet and reliable guy??? He seems scary as an ex-delinquent and as a strict teacher but he's so protective over others. I agree with everything Haruaki said to him in the river in Meiji arc (one of my fave scenes from the manga fr).<br><br>Hijita - again he is so cringefail loserboy and I love him for it. But what really makes him a fave is how he's always the one to notice the pain that his friends are carrying, like with Beniko's dads' inn arc and Renren arc, and how he quietly supports and roots for them by trying his best for them. Also he has some of the coolest entrances imo<br><br>Ibara - love everything about her that Hatanaka does. How she's the strongest of the Miki sisters but is the gentlest to avoid hurting other people. I'm obsessed with how she's such a good big sis to Rintarou, like especially the panels where she goes to hug Rintarou in the flashback where Haru got his soul eaten by Shuutendouji as a kid and you can tell how much anguish she feels that Rintarou had to go through that.<br><br>Notes about other aspects of the series that I love bc I need to talk abt it:<br><br>I love how Tanamai allows her female characters to be just as ridiculous as the male characters. They're not kept as pristine beauties, they can make ugly faces and be vulgar and go feral. Although most of the female characters' roles so far have been tied up in some romantic aspect (Utagawa/Renren, Ibara/Izuna, Momoyama/Sano, Beans/Seimei, Beniko/Hijita (under development), Renjou/her secret crush, Koizumi/Ame that one time), they still have very distinct personalities and are important to the story otherwise too.<br><br>All the friend groups in this series are so pure???? Like they feel so realistic too?? Haru/Rintarou/Izuna friendship makes me cry with how they act annoyed by each other but come to each other's rescue in a heartbeat. Love how we have Sanogang, Nyuudougang, Kurahashi/Toubyou/Maeda, Fuji/Ogoso, the girls, and they all have their own distinct vibe but you can feel the chemistry they have with characters outside their groupings too. And how class 2-3 is one big team even if they don't like everyone in it Tanamai is a genius at characters and chemistry and development holy heck<br><br>Also shoutout to Meiji arc for nailing the angst of the forbidden romance thing on the head. Screamed when I found out my prediction that Kai was gay came true<br><br>I could go on and on about other things but this is getting way too long. It's just such a good manga aghhhhh	Initially it was the characters who had the most focus (Sano gang) but as we learned more about the other characters they became my faves too	No	thank you and please keep translating yohaji forever	Haruaki	Hatanaka, Hijita, Ibara	Haruaki, Hatanaka, Hijita, Ibara	2023	My powerpoint?!			657	Fuji & Ogoso, Teacher trio, Takahashi & Yamazaki

The funny gags transition to heartfelt drama seamlessly and ALL the characters are relatable and Fun to read. I had a similar experience when i was getting into Gintama, one of my favourite mangas, and Yohaji became one of my favourites as well. <br>Also thank you for translating this amazing manga!!

1/4/2025 2:33:43	Twitter	Manga reader	2019	I generally like manga about teachers and their classes, and am pretty interested in yokai. I fell in love with the characters immediately.	Tamao	Haruaki, Sano, Byakko, honestly just everybody lol	The relationship between Haru and Sano was part of what hooked me at the start. It's hilarious how inappropriate and un-teacher-student -like their relationship is. Even still, Haru has been able to give the adult support that Sano needs in his life.  I've been pretty into the relationship between Takahashi and Yamazaki. Like I'm not good at words but like their relationship is so whoaah...   And I guess I gotta also say Fuji and Ogoso. They are lovely and sweet as besties but honestly it's laughable if Fuji still claims to be straight.  It's really hard to talk about just few since the whole manga is packed with amazing friendships and relationships, there's just so much to wonder about	Tamao is my baby my love my son and my light <3 He's so sweet and genuine and so hardworking! I love how even though he is an older brother he's definitely the baby between the triplets. I was so glad he realised his dream to be a teacher, honestly it suits him so well and I bet he's going to be amazing. And most importantly he's a catboy :3<br><br>Other than him it's really hard to choose favorites, since all of them are so lovable! I mostly mentioned Haru and Sano specifically since they're so prominent in the story. And Byakko happens to fit into the very specific type of characters I like (long haired twink with bad personality/kinda tsundere who has a feminine and very proper style)	I think it was maybe Sano, but can't remember for sure	No	I'm really thankful for your translations <3	Tamao	Haruaki, Sano, Byakko	Tamao, Haruaki, Sano, Byakko	2019	School life, Supernatural		Sano	128	Haruaki & Sano, Takahashi & Yamazaki, Fuji & Ogoso
